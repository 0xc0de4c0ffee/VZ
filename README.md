# Uniswap VZ

Contemporary Uniswap V2 Factory (VZ). By [z0r0z](https://x.com/z0r0zzz).

Changes are meant to cause little disruption to the familiar and battle-tested [Uniswap V2 core](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core). While also introducing efficiency and optimized patterns the public has otherwise made through opinionated forks. VZ should consolidate, reform and optimize these variations as much as possible to represent a simple and useable VZ.

Changes include the following:

✵ Latest Solidity Compiler (0.8.26)
✵ Adapted Syntax (e.g. safemath)
✵ *Solady* most of the things *etc.*

## Getting Started

Run: `curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash && source ~/.bashrc && foundryup`
